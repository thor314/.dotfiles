* My dotfiles, organized with [[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot][dotbot]].
Get all the dotfiles:

=git clone github.com/thor314/dotfiles.git && cd .dotfiles && ./install=

Add a =.$DOTFILE=: modify links section in =install.conf.yaml=, which creates a sim-link from =.dotfiles= to the
super directory.

To add another dotfile that's version controlled:

Then move the =$DOTFILE= into =.dotfiles=. Then run =./install=.
